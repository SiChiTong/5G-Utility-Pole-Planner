## Project Mission
<p align="center">
  In order to help company to install 5G equipments on untility Poles, our first aim is to build our first dataset by Google street imagery. With machine leaning, we will import the dataset and analyse the poles in every image so that we can build a 2D model of the whole neighbourhood. At the same time, our team members are going to use the knowledge of 5G and make an abstraction of each equipment as to build the final model.

## Minimum Viable Product

1.Detect the poles from the pictures.
2.

## User Stories

- I, the ..., want to ....

## How it works

1. Get an access to Google Api and utilize it to crawl the pictures from Google Street View. 
2. Use computer vision to detect poles from every picture if there is any.
3. Build a map that shows how the poles scattered around the area we choose.
4. Make a module for each 5U Utilities, including its coverage area.
5. Combine 3 & 4 to reach the final design
